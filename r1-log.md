## Log

### R1D1 - May 27, 2021 
Continued working on my personal portfolio/blog I started way back in December last year. Just figuring out where I left of and what to do next.

### R1D2 - May 28, 2021 
Working on blog, cleaned up a litle, set up eslint and prettier.

I'm thinking to get rid of styled-components and replace it with scss modules. Project still relatively small and it won't take too long, I don't think. But styled-componets is so convinient and it's already set up properly. And project won't ever get too big to have some issues with styled-components. Still not sure

### R1D3 - May 29, 2021 
Started working on authentication with next-auth for my blog, finally created reposetory and stuff
